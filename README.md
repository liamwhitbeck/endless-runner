# Design Document for Endless Runner
This document contains general ideas about the game: overview, story, environment/mechanics, play/interaction, ideas for future features, etc.

## Overview
An ocean-themed endless runner game.

The player is being dragged into a swirling whirlpool in the middle of the ocean. Other objects are being dragged (e.g., wooden boxes, wrecked ships, etc.) and the player has to avoid them. If the player hits anything, they lose balance and fall deeper; otherwise, they can rotate themselves to get further from the center of the whirlpool. The whilrpool will eventually suck the player. But the game measures how long the player can survive; the longer they survive, the harder the game gets.

## Story
Two possible scenarios here:
1) You're on a sailboat/ship in the middle of the ocean. Strong tides and engine failure cause you to go off-course and you get lost. After a while, you find a swirling whirlpool in the horizon that you're being dragged into.
2) Same scenario as 1, but your ship gets wrecked and you're left with a longboard that you can use to surf.
